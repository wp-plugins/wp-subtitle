Add subtitles (subheadings) to your pages, posts or custom post types.

== Description ==

The WP Subtitle plugin allows your pages and posts to contain a subtitle.  Also called a sub-heading, this this short line of text is meant to appear beneath a post's (or page's) title, but can be inserted in your template wherever you choose.

`<?php the_subtitle(); ?>` is used for inside The Loop. If you wish to get a page/post's subtitle outside The Loop, use `<?php get_the_subtitle( $post ); ?>`, where $post is a post object or ID ($post->ID).

= Parameters =

Just like WP's built-in `<?php the_title(); ?>` method, `<?php the_subtitle(); ?>` tag accepts three parameters:

**$before**  
*(string)* Text to place before the subtitle. Defaults to "".

**$after**  
*(string)* Text to place after the subtitle. Defaults to "".

**$echo**  
*(boolean)* If true, display the subtitle in HTML. If false, return the subtitle for use in PHP. Defaults to true.

Things are slightly different in `<?php get_the_subtitle(); ?>`:

**$post**  
*(int|object)* Post, page or custom post type object or ID.

**$before**  
*(string)* Text to place before the subtitle. Defaults to "".

**$after**  
*(string)* Text to place after the subtitle. Defaults to "".

**$echo**  
*(boolean)* If true, display the subtitle in HTML. If false, return the subtitle for use in PHP. Defaults to true.
